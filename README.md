# code-examples

Some simple coding examples for people learning a (new) programming language. The examples are pitched at people with a reasonable maths background (say, up to UK A Level), and interested in STEM applications.

Note that these examples are not targeted specifically at applications to statistical computing and ML - I have other repos for that - eg. [fp-ssc-course](https://github.com/darrenjw/fp-ssc-course) or [logreg](https://github.com/darrenjw/logreg).

Currently, I just have examples for the [C programming language](C/Readme.md) (since I'm currently helping my son to learn C), but I intend to gradually add similar examples in other languages as time permits, possibly in the following order: Scala, Python, Haskell, Rust.
