# Agglom

This is a simple multi-file `sbt` project, simulating a simple 2D agglomeration process and animating the simulation in a window on the console.

Just do `sbt run` from *this* directory to compile and run the application. The actual Scala source code is in [src/main/scala/](src/main/scala).
